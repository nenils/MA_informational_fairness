While many bias metrics and fairness definitions have been proposed in recent years, the community has not reached a consensus on which definitions and metrics should be used, and there has been very little empirical analyses of real-world problems using the proposed metrics.\n","\n","We present the Aequitas toolkit as an intuitive addition to the machine learning workflow, enabling users to to seamlessly test models for several bias and fairness metrics in relation to multiple population groups. We believe the tool will faciliate informed and equitable decision-making around developing and deploying predictive risk-assessment tools for both machine learnining practitioners and policymakers, allowing researchers and program managers to answer a host of questions related to machine learning models, including:\n","\n","- [What biases exist in my model?](#existing_biases)\n","    - [What is the distribution of groups, predicted scores, and labels across my dataset?](#xtab)\n","    - [What are bias metrics across groups?](#xtab_metrics)\n","    - [How do I interpret biases in my model?](#interpret_bias)\n","    - [How do I visualize biases in my model?](#bias_viz)\n","\n","- [What levels of disparity exist between population groups?](#disparities)\n","    - [How does the selected reference group affect disparity calculations?](#disparity_calc)\n","    - [How do I interpret calculated disparity ratios?](#interpret_disp)\n","    - [How do I visualize disparities in my model?](#disparity_viz)\n","\n","- [How do I assess model fairness??](#fairness)\n","    - [How do I interpret parities?](#interpret_fairness)\n","    - [How do I visualize bias metric parity?](#fairness_group_viz)\n","    - [How do I visualize parity between groups in my model?](#fairness_disp_viz)\n","\n","\n","We apply the toolkit to the COMPAS dataset reported on by ProPublica below.\n","\n","### Background\n","\n","The dataset contains information on 614 loan applications, with 13 features including gender, marital status, income, loan amount, credit history, and loan status (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/altruistdelhite04/loan-prediction-problem-dataset). The goal is to build a predictive model to determine the likelihood of loan approval.\n","\n","#### Problem Statement\n","Dreamhouse Loan Company specializes in providing various types of loans across urban, semi-urban, and rural areas. When a loan application is received, the company validates the applicant’s eligibility based on details such as age, house ownership, work experience, loan intent, income, loan amount, and credit history (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/altruistdelhite04/loan-prediction-problem-dataset). The objective is to streamline and automate this process to identify eligible customer segments and optimize loan offerings (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/altruistdelhite04/loan-prediction-problem-dataset).\n","\n","#### History\n","The dataset is part of a broader effort to improve the loan approval process by leveraging data analytics and machine learning. It has been used in various predictive modeling projects to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of loan eligibility assessments (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/altruistdelhite04/loan-prediction-problem-dataset)."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"ExecuteTime":{"end_time":"2020-08-18T18:07:31.068996Z","start_time":"2020-08-18T18:07:11.042342Z"},"id":"g30m7Cvlcy-T"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["tensorflow: 2.4.1\n"]},{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["/opt/anaconda3/envs/aiss_cv_exercise_04/lib/python3.9/site-packages/torch/_functorch/deprecated.py:61: UserWarning: We've integrated functorch into PyTorch.

Effect\n","\n","By breaking down the COMPAS predictions using a variety of bias and disparity metrics calculated using different reference groups, we are able to surface the specific metrics for which

to make similar evaluations on their own data sets, and as they continue to use the tool, will begin to identify patterns in where biases exist and which models appear to produce less bias, thereby

interpret calculated disparity ratios?\n","The calculated disparities from the dataframe returned by the `Bias()` class **`get_disparity_`** methods are in relation to a reference group, which will

Black people are falsely identified as being high or medium risks 1.9 times the rate for white people.\n","\n","As seen above, False Discovery Rates have much less disparity (`fdr_disparity`), or fraction of false postives over predicted positive in a group. As reference groups have disparity = 1 by design in Aequitas, the lower disparity is highlighted by the `fdr_disparity` value close to 1.0 (0.906) for the race attribute group 'African-American' when disparities are calculated using predefined base group 'Caucasian'.
